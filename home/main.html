	  <p>
	    In general, I'm interested in research on computer
	    security. I tend to apply techniques from a wide range of
	    areas within computer science (operating systems,
	    architecture, machine learning) in order to solve security
	    problems.

	    I spent four years in industry with two of them as the
	    Head of Accounts at Twitter and two as Head of Fraud and
	    Identity at Lyft, but now I'm back in academia at UC
	    Davis. If you're interested, I wrote
	    a <a href="https://eng.lyft.com/stopping-fraudsters-by-changing-products-452240f2d2cc">blog
	    post</a> that talks about some of the lessons learned from
	    my time in industry. I also wrote a blog post about why I
	    moved <a href="http://blogs.nature.com/naturejobs/2018/04/30/from-academia-to-silicon-valley-and-back/">from
	    academia to industry and back</a>.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    Currently, I'm working on digital identities, fraud, fake
	    accounts, and robot
	    security. My <a href="research.html">Research</a> page
	    shows a nice summary of some of my past projects, and
	    my <a href="publications.html">Publications</a> page shows
	    a full list of my publications (in case you're looking for
	    reading material to help put you to sleep).
