            <h2>Research Project</h2>
            <p>
              You will design and carry out a semester-long research
              project (done in teams). I hope that these projects will
              lead to published papers. The timeline for the projects
              is as follows:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>XXX:</b> inform me of your group's
                  membership. Groups should generally consist of two
                  people. Your project partner will have a substantial
                  effect on your experience in this course, so choose
                  carefully.
                </li>

                <li>
                  <b>XXX:</b> inform me of your project choice. This
                  will be an email with a brief description of what
                  you plan on doing for the quarter.
                </li>

                <li>
                  <b>YYY:</b> project proposals are due (you can find
                  more information here). Your proposal should state
                  the problem your project will address, the
                  motivation for why this is an interesting problem,
                  the goal of your project, the relationship between
                  your project and other work, the plan and
                  methodology for your project, and the resources
                  needed to carry out your project. Include a set of
                  incremental milestones that you will achieve in
                  carrying out the project and a schedule for meeting
                  these milestones.
                </li>

                <li>
                  <b>ZZZ:</b> Midterm meetings. Each group will meet
                  with me to discuss your project with the class and
                  talk about some of your preliminary results.
                </li>

                <li>
                  <b>AAA:</b> Midterm report due. You should have some
                  preliminary results at this point and should include
                  an introduction, related work, preliminary design,
                  and expected final results.
                </li>

                <li>
                  <b>BBB:</b> Project presentations. You can find more information
                  about presentations in class.
                </li>

                <li>
                  <b>CCC:</b> Final project due.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
              Project groups should be 2-4 members and there can be a
              minimum of one on campus student per group unless
              explicit permission has been granted by the professor.
            </p>

            <p>
              This semester I am not going to give out project
              ideas. You are responsible for coming up with a research
              idea by yourself, but I encourage you to start this
              process early and to solicit feedback from me.
            </p>

            <p>
              For any part of the project you turn in, you must usenix
              two-column formatting. For an example, feel free to
              start from the latex template latex-template.tgz or you
              can use the latex template that I personally use for my
              papers (this one includes a makefile)
              latex-example.tgz. Note: You are required to use LaTeX
              in this class.
            </p>

            <p>
              About Latex, for those of you who are not familiar with it, try to
              read tutorials like this:
              http://www.maths.tcd.ie/~dwilkins/LaTeXPrimer/
            </p>

            <p>
              For windows users, we suggest using MikTeX or Cygwin, or
              http://www.latexeditor.org/index.html  that makes using
              LaTeX a little easier.
