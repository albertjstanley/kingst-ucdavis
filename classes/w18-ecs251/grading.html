            <h2>Grading</h2>
            <p>
              <h5>Turning in work and late policy</h5> Late work will
              receive no credit. You will turn in project milestones
              via email or canvas (TBD).
            </p>

            <p>
            <h5>Cheating policy</h5>
              I have a no tolerance policy on cheating, which includes
              copying from friends and plagarism. If you get caught
              cheating, you will get an F in this class and I will
              turn you into the univerisity's academic integrity
              group.
            </p>

	    <p>
	      <h5>Quizzes</h5> I will give you full credit on your
	      lowest quiz grade for the quarter. That way, if you need
	      to miss a class and there is a quiz, you won't be
	      penalized. If you take all of the quizzes, I will
	      replace your lowest quiz score with full credit.
	    </p>

	    <p>
	      <h5>Leading a lecture</h5> My goal is for all of you to
	      get full credit for leading a lecture! Here's how I will
	      break down the points for your grade when you lead a
	      lecture:
	      <ul>
		<li>
		  (1/3 of total) -- pick meaningful optional
		  reading. Should have 2-3 optional reading items and
		  a few sentences about each that explains why you
		  picked them. Please post the sentences to
		  Canvas.
		</li>
		<li>
		  (1/3 of total) -- The presentation itself (should be
		  5-10 minutes long) that goes over (1) background on
		  the required reading, (2) a balanced view of the
		  issue at hand, and (3) a summary of the optional
		  reading and why you picked it.
		</li>
		<li>
		  (1/3 of total) -- In class discussion. Create good
		  questions, make sure there is a lively discussion.
		</li>
	      </ul>
	      As a challenge to the entire class: come prepared to
	      class so that you can discuss the topics in a lively
	      debate. Since your grade depends on it, please do make
	      sure that you come to class prepared to debate.
	    </p>

            <p>
            <h5>Grade breakdown</h5> Your grade will be composed of
            the following items:
            </p>
            <table class="table table-bordered">
              <thead class="thead-dark">
                <tr>
                  <th>Item</th>
                  <th>Percent</th>
                  <th>Description</th>
                </tr>
              </thead>

                    Five quizzes worth 5% each

                    and results 20%
                  </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>

            <p>
            <h5>Grade scale</h5>
              I grade on a straight grade scale. Although most of the
              points in this class will come towards the end of the
              quarter, the milestones will help give you a sense of
              how well you are doing on the final project.
            </p>
