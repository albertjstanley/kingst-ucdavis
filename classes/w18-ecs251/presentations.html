            <h2>Presentation and discussion leading</h2>
            <p>
              During the semester you will present one paper to the
              class. Each LECTURE will have 1-3 presenters, sign up
              using the wiki (you can modify the reading list page
              directly). You can divide up the presentation
              responsibilities however you see fit and you will be
              graded as a group. Make sure at least one of the
              discussion leaders can attend class. You must present
              the paper(s) in a quals style where you assume everyone
              has read the paper, so you focus on the most important
              aspect of the work. You will also be responsible for
              clearing up any confusing aspects of the paper and for
              leading a discussion. For discussion topics, use the
              suggested newsgroup questions as a starting point for
              thinking about the type of things that would be useful
              for discussion. Here is a rough guideline for how to
              lead a discussion:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>5 minutes (max) of background material.</b>
                  Explain what this paper is about and why it is
                  important. Remember, we can assume everyone has
                  already read the paper so keep it short!
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>10-15 minutes of related work.</b> Discuss some
                  other work that may be related to the papers you are
                  presenting and tie them together to help give a
                  historical context of the work.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>20 minutes small group discussion.</b> Come up
                  with several questions to pose to the class to spark
                  discussions. We will discuss in small groups first.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>20 minutes class discussion.</b> Based on the
                  small group discussions, the class will vote on
                  topics to discuss as an entire class.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
              The first paper available to students is "XXX" on XXX.
            </p>

            <p>
              Note: You must turn in a rough draft of your slides to
              the professor by 4pm the night before your presentation
              and after the presentation you must submit a summary of
              what each student contributed to the presentation.
            </p>

            <p>
              Please also note that you must still submit a newsgroup
              post as usual before your own presentation.
            </p>
