            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
              This class focuses on hot topics in Operating
              Systems. We will discuss classic papers in the area as
              well as cutting-edge research. We will discuss classic
              papers in the area as well as cutting-edge research. We
              will explore new ideas through projects and improve
              skills in presentations, critical thinking, systems and
              security programming, and creativity. The class format
              will consist of lectures, student presentations, guest
              lectures, and class project presentations.
            </p>

            <p>
              The prerequisite for this class is undergraduate
              operating systems. Some of the topics we will explore
              are: kernels, security, reliability and finding bugs,
              and distributed systems.
            </p>

            <h2>Lectures</h2>
            <p>
              You are responsible for knowing about all announcements
              made in lecture. We will discuss expectations about the
              project, suggestions for how to succeed, and grading
              guidelines in class, and general class policy issues, so
              make sure you don't miss any lectures.
            </p>

            <h2>Readings, postings, and class participation</h2>
            <p>
              A major part of this course will be reading, analyzing,
              and discussing papers. We will cover one or two papers
              per lecture typically. Required readings for each class
              are posted on the class web site. For each required
              paper, your assignment is to read the paper carefully
              before the lecture and to post on the course newsgroup
              an insight or question about this paper. A good model is
              the comments and question that take place after someone
              presents a paper at a research conference. The postings
              can take many forms, for example, you could post any of
              the following:
              <ul>
                <li>What you appreciated about the paper</li>
                <li>Where you felt the paper fell short</li>
                <li>Future work that the paper inspired you to think
                of</li>
                <li>Questions about the meaning of a section of the
                paper</li>
                <li>Comparisons between the paper and another paper or
                approach for the same problem</li>
                <li>Relationship between the problem being attacked in
                this paper and another problem</li>
                <li>How the paper relates to another paper or
                approach</li>
                <li>Speculation about how the author's idea would
                apply in a new situation</li>
                <li>Something you wished the author had addressed</li>
                <li>Assumptions in the paper that you disagree with
                and how you think different assumptions would affect
                the outcome</li>
                <li>Answering another student's question or following
                up on another student's comments</li>
              </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
              Your posting need not be long; the ideal is a few
              thought-provoking sentences. You should submit your
              posting to Piazza no later than 11:59pm on the day
              before we discuss the paper. These postings aren't
              graded, but I do expect students to participate.
            </p>

            <p>
              Participating in the in-class discussions on each paper
              is an important part of the class. Lively participation
              by the entire class will help us all understand the
              material better and have more fun in the process.
            </p>

            <h2>Class discussions</h2>
            <p>
              In class we will discuss the papers in two different
              phases. First, we will break into small groups (3-4
              students) to discuss the papers for 10-15 minutes before
              we break into larger groups. This small group discussion
              will be guided by a set of questions given to you at the
              beginning of each class.
