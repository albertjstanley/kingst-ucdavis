            <h2>Project</h2>
            <p>
              You will design and carry out a quarter-long research
              project (done in teams). I hope that these projects will
              lead to published papers. The timeline for the projects
              is as follows:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>5/10:</b> inform me of your group's
                  membership. Groups should generally consist of 3
                  or 4 people. Your project partner will have a
                  substantial effect on your experience in this
                  course, so choose carefully.
                </li>

                <li>
                  <b>5/10:</b> inform me of your project choice. This
                  will be a brief description of what you plan on
                  doing for the quarter.
                </li>

                <li>
                  <b>5/31 - 6/5:</b> Project presentations. You can find more information
                  about presentations in class.
                </li>

                <li>
                  <b>6/12 @ 3:30pm:</b> Final project due.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
              Project groups should be 3-4 members. Any other group
              size needs explicit approval by the professor.
            </p>

            <p>
              This quarter I am not going to give out project
              ideas. You are responsible for coming up with a project
              idea by yourself, but I encourage you to start this
              process early and to solicit feedback from me.
            </p>

	    <h2>Final presentation grading</h2>
	    See slides from lecture for more details on what we're expecting. We will grade you on:
	    <ul>
	      <li>Clarity and quality of presentation</li>
	      <li>Ability to explain the problem and set the appropriate context</li>
	      <li>Ability to explain the system you built</li>
	      <li>Quality of the live demo</li>
	      <li>How well you handle Q/A</li>
	    </ul>

	    <h2>Final project grading</h2> See slides from lecture for
	    more details on what we're expecting. This quarter we're
	    going to use slides and source code as the artifacts that
	    you're going to turn in for your grade. We will grade you
	    on:
	    <ul>
	      <li>Code quality. To get points you must include a
	      README file in your repo that outlines the basic
	      structure of your code and how the concepts from your
	      project map to actual code. Also, we're expecting
	      significant contributions in real source code from all
	      group members.</li>
	      <li>Clarity and quality of explanation</li>
	      <li>How significant was the system you built. We've been
	      giving all groups feedback on this during our weekly
	      meetings, so I'm not expecting any surprises here.</li>
	      <li>Result. Basic results will get you most of the
	      points, but we're reserving a few points in this
	      category for exceptional results.</li>
	    </ul>

	    <h2>Project meetings</h2>
	    <p>
	      During the end of this quarter your group will have
	      weekly meetings with Sam and the TA. <i>Before</i> this
	      meeting we expect you to meet as a group and plan your
	      week. These meetings can be short (30 minutes) but you
	      must meet as a group to talk about what you did over the
	      previous week, what you plan to do during the upcoming
	      week, and any issues or problems that you've
	      encountered.
	    </p>
	    <p>Please note that these meetings are public and anyone
	    is welcome to listen in on anyone else's meetings, but all
	    students are required to be at their meeting time slot</p>
	    <p>
	      As a part of your grade, <i>before</i> your weekly
	      meeting with the professor you must turn in a document
	      that summarizes your meeting. In particular:
	      <ul>
		<li>You will use Trello to keep an up-to-date list of
		what everyone is doing. Your Trello board will have a
		list of tasks divided into four categories: up next
		(priority order), in progress, blocked, and done.</li>
		<li>You will submit a short summary for all group
		members that includes a few sentences about (1) what
		did they do last week, (2) what are they going to do
		this week, and (3) any issues they're having / things
		they're stuck on.</li>
		<li>You will draft this document using Markdown and
		github. You will submit a link to this document
		directly in this assignment.</li>
		<li>Your document will include a link to your Trello
		board and any commits that team members submitted in
		the previous week.</li>
	      </ul>
	      Please note that we are expecting all group members to
	      commit meaningful code each week, which we will review
	      in our weekly meetings.
