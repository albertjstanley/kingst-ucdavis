            <h2>Project</h2>
            <p>
              You will design and carry out a quarter-long project
              where you will write an iOS app (done in teams). I hope
              that these projects will lead apps in the App Store. The
              timeline for the projects is as follows:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>11/5:</b> Inform me of your group's membership
                  and few sentence description of the app you plan to
                  build. Groups should generally consist of three or
                  four people. Your project partners will have a
                  substantial effect on your experience in this
                  course, so choose carefully.
                </li>

                <li>
                  <b>11/13:</b> Milestone 1. This milestone includes
                  preliminary designs with how you plan to decompose
                  your app, descriptions of libraries you plan to use,
                  what you plan to do for server support, and a
                  timeline of when we can expect tasks to be done and
                  who is going to do them. <b>We'll set your
                  Professor's Challenge in your Milestone 1
                  meeting.</b>
		</li>

                <li>
                  <b>11/26:</b> Milestone 2 due. Milestone 2
                  will be set during your "Milestone 1" meeting with
                  me and the TA.
                </li>

		<li>
		  <b>12/7:</b> Live demos. You will demo your app to
		  the rest of the class during the lecture period.
		</li>

                <li>
                  <b>12/7:</b> Final project due.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
              Project groups should be 3-4 members. Any other group
              size needs explicit approval by the professor.
            </p>

            <p>
              This quarter I am not going to give out project
              ideas. You are responsible for coming up with an app
              idea by yourself, but I encourage you to start this
              process early and to solicit feedback from me.
            </p>

	    <h4>Project proposal</h4>
	    <p>
	      Write a few sentences describing the app that you plan
	      to build. It doesn't have to be detailed, we're only
	      want to get a general idea of what direction you're
	      thinking about going to make sure that your project is
	      appropriate for this class.

	    <p>
	      We have enabled self-signup for group membership, so
	      please make sure to create a group for your team and
	      assign all of the members of your team to your group.
	    </p>

	    <p>
	      You should be able to submit a single proposal for the
	      entire group using Canvas' group feature.
