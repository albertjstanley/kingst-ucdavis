            <h2>Project</h2>
            <p>
              You will design and carry out a quarter-long project
              where you will write an iOS app (done in teams). I hope
              that these projects will lead apps in the App Store. The
              timeline for the projects is as follows:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>10/19:</b> Inform me of your group's membership
                  and few sentence description of the app you plan to
                  build. Groups should generally consist of three or
                  four people. Your project partners will have a
                  substantial effect on your experience in this
                  course, so choose carefully.
                </li>

                <li>
                  <b>10/26:</b> Project proposal. Your proposal
                  includes preliminary designs with how you plan to
                  decompose your app, descriptions of libraries you
                  plan to use, what you plan to do for server support,
                  and a timeline of when we can expect tasks to be
                  done.
		</li>

                <li>
                  <b>11/9:</b> Milestone 1 due. Milestone 1 will be
                  set during your "Project proposal" meeting with me
                  and the TA.
                </li>

                <li>
                  <b>11/19 and 11/21:</b> Milestone 2 due. Milestone 2
                  will be set during your "Milestone 1" meeting with
                  me and the TA.
                </li>

		<li>
		  <b>12/5 and 12/7:</b> Live demos. You will demo your
		  app to the rest of the class during the lecture
		  period.
		</li>

                <li>
                  <b>12/7:</b> Final project due.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
              Project groups should be 3-4 members. Any other group
              size needs explicit approval by the professor.
            </p>

            <p>
              This quarter I am not going to give out project
              ideas. You are responsible for coming up with an app
              idea by yourself, but I encourage you to start this
              process early and to solicit feedback from me.
