            <h2>Final paper</h2>
            <p>
              Your paper is to be based on either a book or a
              topic. Here is a
              <a href="http://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~rogaway/classes/188/materials/books.html">
                list of possible books
              </a>. Please note that this list is not meant to be
              exhaustive: you are free to pick another book that you
              like, as long as it is related to ethics and
              technology. I will not give a list of suggested topics
              so that you can decide what you want to talk
              about. Again, topics only need to be related to ethics
              and technology. Be careful not to pick a topic that is
              too broad. I suggest that you discuss your topic with me
              early on.
            </p>

            <p>
              The paper should be no less than 2000 words (about
              8-pages). The paper should be written with an intended
              audience of me and your classmates. Write something that
              you yourself would want to be given to read.
            </p>

            <p>
              Your paper should be carefully written: it will be
              graded for writing quality. Make sure to give full
              references in the bibliography (eg., author, title,
              journal, publisher, pages, date; a URL alone is rarely a
              reference by itself). Include all necessary citations
              and footnotes. Please number all pages. Follow standard
              stylistic conventions (any fixed set of conventions you
              select). I like left-and-right justified text, but this
              is not an obligation. Use a pleasant-to-read font (not
              Arial or any other sans serif font).
            </p>

            <p>
              I will provide a LaTeX template for any students who are
              interested. It provides great support for bibilographies
              and produces high-quality documents.
            </p>

            <p>
              We will spend time in class discussing how to write an
              appropriate paper. Think, organize, think, and
              organize. Write and rewrite.
            </p>

            <h2>A team project</h2>
            <p>
              You will work in a <b>team of two</b> on your project
              (term paper + oral presentation). Larger or smaller
              teams will not be permitted unless you make a good case
              for it. Each team will submit one paper and do one
              presentation. All team members get the same grade.
            </p>

            <h2>Organization</h2>
            <p>
              There are two <i>required</i> milestones:

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Milestone 1:</b> The paper proposal. In it you
                  will identify the book or topic you want to cover,
                  and with whom you will work. Submit Milestone 1 via
                  email to me. Feedback will be minimal: either I like
                  your book/topic, or I don't. If I don't like your
                  proposal, you will have to find another topic. The
                  most common reasons for my rejecting a proposal: (a)
                  the book or topic is already taken; (b) the topic is
                  unclear or too broad; and (c) the topic or book is
                  not related to ethics and technology.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Milestone 2:</b> A rough draft of your paper. The
                  draft should be most of your paper - any omitted
                  portion should be modest in breadth and the
                  unfinished portion clearly circumscribed. Please
                  submit Milestone 2 via email. Include a word
                  count at the top of your Milestone 2.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
              You will not be penalized if you do not turn in
              Milestone 1 or Milestone 2.... however, do notice that
              you are penalizing yourself as you will not get any
              feedback. The final version of the paper needs to be
              turned in via email by the due date.
            </p>
