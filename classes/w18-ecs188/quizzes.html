            <h2>Quizzes</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Quizzes will be given at the beginning of class and
                you will have 10 minutes to answer the questions.
              </li>
              <li>
                All of the quizzes will be short (up to 5 questions),
                and easy... as long as you have done the reading.
              </li>
              <li>
                I expect to give eight quizzes over the quarter.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Reports</h2> During the quarter, I will ask you to
            turn in three reports on the reading material. Reports are
            either a 1-2 page opinion essays on the reading material
            for the lectureor a 0.5 - 1 page summary, and the report
            due dates are marked on
            the <a href="lectures.html">lectures</a> page.

            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Analysis:</b> If I ask you to turn in an analysis,
                I am asking for your own opinion about the text. You
                may decide to take one point that you either strongly
                agree with, or strongly disagree with, and discuss
                it. You may decide to give an opiniated overview of
                the whole text. It is your choice. However, I want you
                to be specific: no generalities, no unsupported
                opinions. Make sure to credit any ideas that is not
                yours. <b>An analysis should be 1 to 2 pages long.</b>
              </li>

              <li>
                <b>Summary:</b> If I ask you to turn in a summary, I
                am expected an unbiased account of what the paper
                says. Do not indicate whether you agree of disagree
                with what the authors say. Make sure to write in
                prose: bullet points for example are not OK. <b>A
                summary should be 0.5 to 1 page long.</b>
              </li>
