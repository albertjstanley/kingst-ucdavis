            <h2>Final presentation</h2>
            <p>
              Each team will do a presentation on their term paper at
              the end of the quarter. It should be well-rehearsed and
              all team members must participate. You should use
              prepared slides for your presentation. Most students use
              PowerPoint, but any other tool will do. Either bring in
              your own laptop to class or use mine (send me a PDF
              version of your presentation in that case). Note that an
              effective presentation does not look like a sequence of
              bulleted lists. I will spend some time in class talking
              to you about giving talks.
            </p>

            <h2>In class presentations</h2>
            <p>
              You will be responsible for leading the discussion at
              the beginning of class once this quarter. Each lecture
              has a maximum of two presentors per lecture. You are
              free to divide up the work however you see fit and you
              will both get the same grade.
            </p>
	    <p>
	      For the lecture that you present, you are responsible
	      for selecting the optional readings for the topic, which
	      must be posted to the reading list before the lecture
	      that you lead.
