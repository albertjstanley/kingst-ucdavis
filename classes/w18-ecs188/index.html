            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
              Tip of the hat to Phil Rogaway and Patrice Koehl, who
              created most of this material.
            </p>

            <p>
              The course material will be broad, open-ended, and
              unlike anything else that begins with the letters ECS
              most of the class time will be spent with you guys
              talking. At the end of the term, your evaluation will
              state the following: My goal is to increase your
              inclination to think about, and act upon, the ethical
              implications of your personal and professional choices,
              and our collective work as technologists. Iâ€™d also like
              you to read a lot, to write a fair amount, and to become
              more comfortable participating in oral discussions and
              giving an oral presentation.

            <h2>Grading</h2>

            <p>
              <h5>Late policy</h5>
              Late reports will receive no credit and they are due on
              the day before the lecture where we discuss the
              material. You will turn in reports via email, and they
              way I define on time is that it is in my inbox before I
              wake up and check my email the day of the lecture
              (warning: I wake up early!).
            </p>

            <p>
            <h5>Cheating policy</h5>
              I have a no tolerance policy on cheating, which includes
              copying from friends and plagarism. If you get caught
              cheating, you will get an F in this class and I will
              turn you into the univerisity's academic integrity
              group.
            </p>

            <p>
            <h5>Grade breakdown</h5>
            Your grade will be composed of the following items:

            <table class="table table-bordered">
              <thead class="thead-dark">

                    You are expected to participate in all of the
                    classroom discussions. I am hoping that you will
                    express your views.

                    Your final presentation will be at the end of the
                    quarter and will summarize your final report.

                    long using a format that I will specify.

            <h5>Grade scale</h5>
              I grade on a straight grade scale. Although most of the
              points in this class will come towards the end of the
              quarter, the milestones will help give you a sense of
              how well you are doing on the final project.
