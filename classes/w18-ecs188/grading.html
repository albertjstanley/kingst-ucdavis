            <p>
              <h5>Turning in work and late policy</h5> Late reports
              will receive no credit and they are due on the day
              before the lecture where we discuss the material. For
              anything that you turn in, we will use Canvas.
            </p>

            <p>
            <h5>Cheating policy</h5>
              I have a no tolerance policy on cheating, which includes
              copying from friends and plagarism. If you get caught
              cheating, you will get an F in this class and I will
              turn you into the univerisity's academic integrity
              group.
            </p>

            <h5>Grade breakdown</h5>
            Your grade will be composed of the following items:
            </p>
            <table class="table table-bordered">
              <thead class="thead-dark">
                <tr>
                  <th>Item</th>
                  <th>Percent</th>
                  <th>Description</th>
                </tr>
              </thead>

                  <td><a href="discussion.html">Class participation</a></td><td>10%</td>
                  <td>
                    You are expected to participate in all of the
                    classroom discussions, and I am hoping that you
                    will express your views. Your grade for
                    participation is based on attendance to discussion
                    section, where you will get 2% per discussion
                    section for showing up, for a total of 10% of your
                    total grade + 2% extra credit (there are six
                    discussion sections total this quarter).

                  <td>
                    You will turn in three brief reports (1-2 pages)
                    on the reading material, due the day before the
                    class during which we discuss the material (4%
                    each for 12% of your total grade) + eight in-class
                    quizzes (not announced, worth 1% of your final
                    grade each for a total of 8%).
                  </td>
                </tr>

                  <td><a href="final_paper.html">Final paper</a></td><td>35%</td>
                  <td>
                    Your final paper will be approximately 2000 words
                    long using a format that I will specify. Your
                    final paper consists of two milestones: Milestone
                    1 (5% of your total grade) and Milestone 2 (10% of
                    your total grade) + a final report (20% of your
                    total grade).
                  </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td><a href="presentations.html">Presentations</a></td><td>35%</td>
                  <td>
                    During the quarter, you will lead the discussion
                    for 1 lecture (15% of your total grade), and you
                    will present your final project to the class (20%
                    of your total grade).  Your final presentation
                    will be at the end of the quarter and will
                    summarize your final report.

            <h5>Grade scale</h5>
              I grade on a straight grade scale. Although most of the
              points in this class will come towards the end of the
              quarter, the milestones will help give you a sense of
              how well you are doing on the final project.
