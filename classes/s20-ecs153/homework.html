            <h2>Homework</h2> 
	    <p>
	      For each of the "Big ideas" that we cover in class, we
	      will have you submit a write up of the big idea. This
	      write up will consist of (1) a list of the main concepts
	      that we covered and (2) any future work that this big
	      idea inspired. If it didn't inspire any future work,
	      then how it changed the way you thought about
	      something. The key thing we're looking for is a
	      high-level synthesis of the material we covered.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      The homework write up will be short -- we aren't asking
	      you to write an essay. The ideal homework will include a
	      few bullet points that concisely summarize the key
	      concepts and two paragraphs about some future work that
	      these papers / ideas inspired.
