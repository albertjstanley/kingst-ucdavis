            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
	      This class focuses on computer security, but due to
	      COVID-19 we are going to teach it completely
	      online. Given the online nature of this class, I am
	      moving away from a more traditional computer security
	      class for undergrads and towards a "Big ideas in
	      computer security" class instead. To try to make the
	      transition to online as smooth as possible, we will
	      follow these principles:
	      <ul>
		<li>
		  All of our material, except for quizzes, will be
		  available asynchronously. We will have lectures and
		  discussions in these lectures, but we will also
		  record them so that students who have techical
		  difficulties or otherwise can not attend can still
		  see the material.
		</li>
		<li>
		  We will provide high quality materials for students
		  to consume at their own pace, usually in the form
		  videos of authors of papers presenting about their
		  own material.
		</li>
		<li>
		  Our primary goal is to expose you to interesting
		  aspects of modern computer security in the first
		  part of the course. We might shift to more
		  traditional material in the second half
		  (specifically applied cryptography) or we might
		  continue with the whole big ideas theme.
		</li>
		<li>
		  We will have a final group project, but will
		  maintain a significantly lower bar for scope then we
		  have in past quarters.
		</li>
	      </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
              The prerequisite for this class is undergraduate
              operating systems.
            </p>

            <h2>Lectures</h2>
	    <p>
	      Some of the material that we cover is fairly
	      advanced. Don't worry -- we don't expect you to
	      understand everything based off of a video. We will use
	      lecture time to cover the basics. I do, however, think
	      that it's important to try to understand the material
	      ahead of time as it will make the explainations during
	      lecture time make more sense.
	    </p>
            <p>	      
              You are responsible for knowing about all announcements
              made in lecture. We will discuss expectations about the
              project, suggestions for how to succeed, and grading
              guidelines in class, and general class policy issues, so
              make sure you don't miss any lectures.
            </p>
