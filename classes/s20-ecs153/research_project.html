            <h2>Project</h2>
            <p>
              You will design and carry out a quarter-long research
              project (done in teams). I hope that these projects will
              Give you some first-hand experience with security, but
              in a topic of your choosing. Our timeline is:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>5/1:</b> inform me of your group's
                  membership. Groups should generally consist of 3
                  or 4 people. Your project partner will have a
                  substantial effect on your experience in this
                  course, so choose carefully.
                </li>

                <li>
                  <b>5/8:</b> inform me of your project choice. This
                  will be a brief description of what you plan on
                  doing for the quarter.
                </li>

		<li>
		  <b>5/12:</b> Milestone 1
		</li>
		
		<li>
		  <b>5/19:</b> Milestone 2
		</li>

		<li>
		  <b>5/26:</b> Milestone 3
		</li>

                <li>
                  <b>5/29 - 6/3:</b> Project presentations. You can find more information
                  about presentations in class.
                </li>

                <li>
                  <b>6/9 @ 12:30pm:</b> Final project due.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
              Project groups should be 3-4 members. Any other group
              size needs explicit approval by the professor.
            </p>

            <p>
              This quarter I am not going to give out project
              ideas. You are responsible for coming up with a project
              idea by yourself, but I encourage you to start this
              process early and to solicit feedback from me.
            </p>

	    <h2>Github organization and content</h2>

	    <p>
	      The center of the project is your github repo this
	      quarter. We are using github classroom to create
	      repositories, and when you submit your project groups
	      we’ll create a github classroom repo for your
	      project. Each time you turn in something, you’ll turn in
	      a link to a doc in your github repo.
	    </p>

	    <ul>
	      <li>
		<b>proposal.md</b> A markdown file that includes your
		proposal
	      </li>
	      <li>
		<b>milestones.md</b> For everyone in the group include
		one sentence on each of these (1) what you did last
		week (2) what you plan to do this week (3) anything
		that you’re stuck on. Also include links to any PRs
		you committed or design docs you wrote.
	      </li>
	      <li>
		<b>design_docs.md</b> A markdown file that includes a
		one sentence description of a design doc and a link to
		your Google doc. Please make sure that the staff can
		access your Google docs or else you will not get
		credit for it.
	      </li>
	    </ul>

	    <h2>Proposal</h2>
	    <p>
	      Send us a paragraph about (1) what problem are you
	      solving, (2) why is it important, (3) what do you plan
	      to build, and (4) what are your expected results. Your
	      proposal should be around 300 words (please don't go
	      over) and your prose should be polished (make sure that
	      it flows well and is free of spelling and grammar
	      mistakes).
	    </p>

	    <h2>Meetings and milestones</h2>
	    <p>
	      We want you to meet each week as a group to coordinate
	      with your group members. In this meeting for each member
	      of the group you should discuss (1) what you did last
	      week, (2) what you plan to do this week, and (3)
	      anything you’re stuck on. These status updates should
	      only take about 10 minutes total for the group and you
	      should spend the remaining 20 minutes talking about some
	      aspect of the project that needs further discussion.
	    </p>

	    <p>
	      One important aspect of your meeting notes is keeping
	      track of action items and revisiting action items from
	      previous weeks. As you meet, you’ll figure out what
	      needs to be done, make sure that it’s clearly documented
	      who’s doing what and make sure that you follow up about
	      the previous week’s action items to make sure that
	      things are getting done.
	    </p>
	    
	    <p>
	      For your milestone, you will submit a doc that contains
	      your meeting notes that includes one sentence for each
	      person and for each of the updates (last week, this
	      week, blocked), plus links to pull requests committed
	      for each person and any design docs you wrote.
	    </p>
	    
	    <p>
	      <b>Design docs are an important aspect of your
	      milestones and each group member needs to author at
	      least one design doc and submit it to one of the three
	      milestones.</b>
	    </p>

	    <h2>Design docs</h2>

	    <p>
	      Design docs are a critical way to communicate technical
	      information, especially as we are all remote this
	      quarter. Your goal with a design doc is to introduce a
	      problem and explain, from a high level, how you plan to
	      solve it. Here is
	      an <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1shp9Z-tdlOwJN7a4kJVIl-dEn1qzcjvUiBE1nlhlus0/edit">example
	      of a real design doc</a> that I wrote personally. After
	      reading a design doc, people should understand what
	      you’re doing and why, and enough of the details of how
	      that they would come up with a reasonably similar
	      implementation. Note: if you find yourself including
	      code snippets in your design doc, then you are going
	      into too much detail. Keep the discussion at a
	      conceptual level and leave code for your pull requests.
	    </p>

	    <p>
	      Your design docs should be 1-2 pages long, written in
	      Google docs, have comments from your teammates about any
	      clarifications / suggestions / discussions, and contain
	      the following:
	    </p>

	    <ul>
	      <li>
		An introduction section, which is 2-3 paragraphs
		explaining the problem, from a high level, why it’s
		important and a sketch of the solution.
	      </li>
	      
	      <li>
		An overview section for your solution. Go into some
		technical details here, but keep things at a
		conceptual level.
	      </li>
	      
	      <li>
		A figure within your overview section to explain the
		main components of your system, the flow of
		information, or something else visually. Having a
		figure is absolutely critical and probably where
		you’ll spend most of your time (coming up with good
		figures is hard).
	      </li>
	      
	      <li>
		A public interfaces section. If you’re working on a
		server component this includes APIs that you’re going
		to expose, or if you’re working on a module this
		includes any methods that other components will
		invoke, or if it’s a stand alone tool then the inputs
		and outputs for this tool. The most important part
		here is that you’re going to be working with other
		people so then need to know how to interact with what
		you write, but they don’t need to know how you
		implement these interfaces.
	      </li>
	    </ul>
	    
	    <h2>Final presentation grading</h2> For your final
	    presentation, you will record a video describing your
	    final project for the class. We'll provide details about
	    what we expect in the second half of the quarter. We will
	    dedicate some time in class for us to all view the videos
	    together and then allow the authors to answer questions
	    from the class live.
	    <ul>
	      <li>Clarity and quality of presentation</li>
	      <li>Ability to explain the problem and set the appropriate context</li>
	      <li>Ability to explain the system you built</li>
	      <li>Quality of the live demo</li>
	    </ul>

	    <h2>Final project grading</h2> See slides from lecture for
	    more details on what we're expecting. This quarter we're
	    going to use slides and source code as the artifacts that
	    you're going to turn in for your grade. We will grade you
	    on:
	    <ul>
	      <li>Code quality. To get points you must include a
	      README file in your repo that outlines the basic
	      structure of your code and how the concepts from your
	      project map to actual code. Also, we're expecting
	      significant contributions in real source code from all
	      group members.</li>
	      <li>Clarity and quality of explanation</li>
	      <li>How significant was the system you built. We've been
	      giving all groups feedback on this during our weekly
	      meetings, so I'm not expecting any surprises here.</li>
	      <li>Result. Basic results will get you most of the
	      points, but we're reserving a few points in this
	      category for exceptional results.</li>
	    </ul>
