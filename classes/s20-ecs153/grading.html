            <h2>Grading</h2>
            <p>
              <h5>Turning in work and late policy</h5> Late work will
              receive no credit. You will turn in project milestones
              and homework via Canvas.
            </p>

            <p>
            <h5>Cheating policy</h5>
              I have a no tolerance policy on cheating, which includes
              copying from friends and plagarism. If you get caught
              cheating, you will get an F in this class and I will
              turn you into the univerisity's academic integrity
              group.
            </p>

	    <p>
	      <h5>Quizzes</h5> I will give you full credit on your
	      lowest quiz grade for the quarter. That way, if you need
	      to miss a class and there is a quiz, you won't be
	      penalized. If you take all of the quizzes, I will
	      replace your lowest quiz score with full credit.
	    </p>

            <p>
            <h5>Grade breakdown</h5> Your grade will be composed of
            the following items:
            </p>
            <table class="table table-bordered">
              <thead class="thead-dark">
                <tr>
                  <th>Item</th>
                  <th>Percent</th>
                  <th>Description</th>
                </tr>

                    8 quizzes worth 3% each

		    TBD because this is going to be very different this quarter
                  </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td><a href="homework.html">Homework</a></td><td>24%</td>
                  <td>We will have eight homework assignments this quarter, each worth 3%.</td>
                </tr>
		<tr>
		  <td>COVID-19 bump</td><td>24%</td>
		  <td>
		    We're going to give everyone 24 points this
		    quarter as a way to recognize the difficulty of
		    taking classes online and to compensate for our
		    inability to teach as well without being in
		    person.

            <h5>Grade scale</h5>
              I grade on a straight grade scale. Although most of the
              points in this class will come towards the end of the
              quarter, the milestones will help give you a sense of
              how well you are doing on the final project.
