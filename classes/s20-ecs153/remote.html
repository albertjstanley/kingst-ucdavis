            <h1>Doing remote projects well</h1>
            <p>
	      Working remotely is different than working in the same
	      physical space. Although it is different, it doesn’t
	      have to be worse. Given the complications of COVID-19,
	      we’re going to embrace remote work culture in our course
	      projects. Much of this was pulled from gitlab’s page on
	      how they operate
	      an <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/">all
	      remote company</a> and adapted to what would be
	      appropriate for this class.
	    </p>

	    <h2>Informal communication is important</h2>

	    One of the key benefits of working together are the human
	    connections you make with people when you spend all of
	    your working hours together. Here are some suggestions for
	    how to retain these connections while working remote:
	    
	    <ul>
	      <li>Zoom lunch together once a week</li>
	      <li>Find a video game or Netflix show or some other
	      online activity that you can all play together
	      online</li>
	      <li>Create and use a coffee-shop channel in slack. I
	      post pictures of my dog there.</li>
	    </ul>

	    <h2>Everything needs to be written down and asynchronous</h2>

	    While working remotely, you have been increasingly good at
	    writing down things. COVID-19 has forced a discipline
	    around writing that you should use:
	    <ul>
	      <li>All meetings must have a written agenda, recurring
	      meetings have a running agenda, and the person who
	      organizes the meeting writes down action items (and
	      follows up on them!)</li>
	      <li>Any significant subsystems in your project should
	      have a short design doc
	      (<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1shp9Z-tdlOwJN7a4kJVIl-dEn1qzcjvUiBE1nlhlus0/edit?usp=sharing">this
	      is an example</a>). The goal of a design doc is to
	      explain the concepts in a way that (1) people can
	      comment on it and provide feedback and (2) your group
	      members would be able to come up with a reasonably
	      similar implementation.</li>
	      <li>All docs should be editable by anyone, everyone
	      should be proactive in updating them to make sure that
	      they provide the best info available</li>
	      <li>Have a top-level directory in your github project
	      called "Library" for all of your design docs.</li>
	      <li>Have a top-level directory in your github project
	      called “Meetings” to document the agenda and action
	      items from your meetings.</li>
	    </ul>
