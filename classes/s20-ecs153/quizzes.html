		8 in class quizzes this quarter, which will cover the
		content in a video that you are to watch before class.
              </li>
              <li>
		You will have 5 minutes to complete the quiz, which
		will consist of true/false and multiple choice
		questions.
              </li>
              <li>
		Our plan is to make the quizzes easy. The hope is that
		it's enough of an incentive to get people to watch the
		videos ahead of time. If it isn't we'll have to come
		up with another plan.
