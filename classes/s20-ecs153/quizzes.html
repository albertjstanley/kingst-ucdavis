              <li>
		8 in class quizzes this quarter, which will cover the
		content in a video that you are to watch before class
		or videos that we have discussed in previous
		lectures. Although we will generally stick to content
		from the last week we do reserve the right to ask
		about past material, so if you miss a class please
		make sure to watch the video.
              </li>
              <li>
		You will have 5 minutes to complete the quiz, which
		will consist of true/false and multiple choice
		questions.
              </li>
              <li>
		Our plan is to make the quizzes easy. The hope is that
		it's enough of an incentive to get people to watch the
		videos ahead of time. If it isn't we'll have to come
		up with another plan.
              </li>
	      <li>
		Quizzes are pop quizzes, meaning that we won't
		announce when we plan to give them. The first lecture
		that we might give a quiz is 4/8/2020.
