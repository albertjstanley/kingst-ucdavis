            <p>
              <h5>Turning in work and late policy</h5> Late work will
              receive no credit. However, you have two free "late days"
              that you can use at anytime during the quarter on a
              project. A late day gives you one extra day
              to turn in your homework without penalty. The purpose of
              these late days is to help you deal with unexpected
              events, including getting sick, going to the doctor, or
              any other events that might cause you to turn in your
              homework late.
	    </p>

	    <p> If you'd like to use a late day, please email the
	    professor and the TA to let us know. </p>


            <p>
            <h5>Cheating policy</h5>
              I have a no tolerance policy on cheating, which includes
              copying from friends and plagarism. If you get caught
              cheating, you will get an F in this class and I will
              turn you into the univerisity's academic integrity
              group.
            </p>

            <p>
            <h5>Grade breakdown</h5> Your grade will be composed of
            the following items:
