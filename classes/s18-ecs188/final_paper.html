            <h2>Final paper</h2>
            <p>
              Your paper is to be based on a
              topic. Here is a
              <a href="http://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~rogaway/classes/188/materials/books.html">
                list of relevant books
              </a> to give you some ideas. Please note that this list
              is not meant to be exhaustive: you are free to pick
              another topic that you like, as long as it is related to
              ethics and technology. I will not give a list of
              suggested topics so that you can decide what you want to
              talk about. Again, topics only need to be related to
              ethics and technology. Be careful not to pick a topic
              that is too broad. I suggest that you discuss your topic
              with me early on.
            </p>
	    
	    <p>
	      Your final paper will be a <b>topic analysis</b> where
	      you pick a topic of interest, and analyze <i>at least</i> 5-10 academic
	      papers on the
	      topic. Greely's <a href="/assets/ecs188/Greely_08.pdf">paper</a>
	      is a good example of what I'm expecting here.
	    </p>

            <p>
              The paper should be no less than 2000 words and no more
              than 2500 (about 8-pages). The paper should be written
              with an intended audience of me and your
              classmates. Write something that you yourself would want
              to be given to read.
            </p>

            <p>
              Your paper should be carefully written: it will be
              graded for writing quality. Make sure to give full
              references in the bibliography (eg., author, title,
              journal, publisher, pages, date; a URL alone is rarely a
              reference by itself). Include all necessary citations
              and footnotes.
            </p>

	    <p>
	      The paper is a research paperâ€”research in the sense of
	      learning some of the scholarship for some particular
	      area, not research in the sense of doing creative
	      scholarship of your own. Make sure your sources
	      represent actual scholarship, not random web pages,
	      blogs, or the like. Please also take a position. This
	      position should be short and it must be well marked, but
	      I would also like to hear your conclusion of the topic.
	    </p>
	    
            <p>
              You will use LaTeX for your milestones and final paper,
              and I will provide
              a <a href="/assets/ecs188/latex-example.tgz">LaTeX
              template</a> for you to use. It provides great support
              for bibilographies and produces high-quality documents.
            </p>

            <p>
              We will spend time in class discussing how to write an
              appropriate paper. Think, organize, think, and
              organize. Write and rewrite. Please check the
              appropriate lecture notes for more details on this.
            </p>

            <h2>A team project</h2>
            <p>
              You will work in a <b>team of two</b> on your project
              (term paper + oral presentation). Larger or smaller
              teams will not be permitted unless you make a good case
              for it. Each team will submit one paper and do one
              presentation. All team members get the same grade.
            </p>

            <h2>Organization</h2>
            <p>
              There are two <i>required</i> milestones:

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Milestone 1:</b> The paper proposal. In it you
                  will identify the topic you want to cover, with whom
                  you will work, and the name of your group. Submit
                  Milestone 1 via Canvas. Feedback will be minimal:
                  either I like your book/topic, or I don't. If I
                  don't like your proposal, you will have to find
                  another topic. The most common reasons for my
                  rejecting a proposal: (a) the book or topic is
                  already taken; (b) the topic is unclear or too
                  broad; and (c) the topic or book is not related to
                  ethics and technology.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Milestone 2:</b> A complete draft of your
                  introduction, plus an outline for the rest of your
                  paper. Your outline should be at least a
                  paragraph-level summary of what you plan to talk
                  about. You should have picked your references and
                  know most of the arguments you're going to
                  make. Please submit Milestone 2 via Canvas. Include
                  a word count at the top of your Milestone 2.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </p>

            <h2>Due dates</h2>
            <table class="table table-bordered">
              <thead class="thead-dark">
                <tr>

              </tbody>
            </table>

	    <h2>Milestone 2</h2>
	    <p>Milestone 2 consists of three parts: an introduction, a
	    rough outline of the rest of your paper, and a list of
	    citations you plan to use.</p>

	    <p>
	      For your introduction, here is a suggested outline:
	    </p>
	    <ul>
	      <li>1-2 paragraphs: Summary of technology in question and why it's important</li>
	      <li>1-3 paragraphs: Summary of ethical issues with that technology</li>
	      <li>2-4 paragraphs: Summary of points you will cover, classify positions and summarize</li>
	      <li>1 paragraph: Your position -- keep this short</li>
	    </ul>

	    <p>
	      If you do a good job on your introduction, you can use
	      it directly in your final project. The purpose of your
	      introduction is to give the reader a brief introduction
	      to the topic without going into too much detail. A
	      reader should be able to read your introduction an know
	      where you are going to take the rest of the essay, even
	      if they don't know specifically how you'll back up your
	      claims.
	    </p>

	    <p> For the rest of Milestone 2, please include</p>
	    <ul>
	      <li>An outline of the rest of your essay. About one sentence per paragraph is the right level of detail at this point in time.</li>
	      <li>A list of potential references</li>
	    </ul>

	    <h2>Milestone 2 requirements</h2>
	    <p>
	      For Milestone 2, you will:
	    </p>
	    <ul>
	      <li>Use LaTeX and submit a PDF. I have a <a href="/assets/ecs188/latex-example.tgz">latex template</a> that you are welcome to use to get you started.</li>
	      <li>Your intro should be around 600-700 words. Please do not go over 800 words.</li>
	      <li>Submit via Canvas using your group. We will create groups for you based on what you turned in for Milestone 1.</li>
	      <li>If you would like early feedback, please submit to Canvas by the end of the day on 4/30 and we'll provide feedback by 5/2. This is your best way to understand what we're looking for if you're feeling uneasy about this assignment.</li>
