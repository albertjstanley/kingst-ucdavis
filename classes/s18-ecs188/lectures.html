            <p>
              Most lectures include a required reading assignment that
              is to be completed before class. In class, we will
              discuss the topic first in small groups and then as a
              class. I will provide a PDF version of the paper to be
              read and/or a link to a web version of the paper.
            </p>

	      Doc</a> for the lecture that you'd like to lead (there
	      should be 2-3 students for each lecture). I sync the
	      Google Doc and the course website periodically, so it
	      might take a little bit of time for your addition to
