            <h2>Grading</h2>
            <p>
              <h5>Turning in work and late policy</h5> Late reports
              will receive no credit and they are due on the day
              before the lecture where we discuss the material. For
              anything that you turn in, we will use Canvas.
            </p>

            <p>
            <h5>Cheating policy</h5>
              I have a no tolerance policy on cheating, which includes
              copying from friends and plagarism. If you get caught
              cheating, you will get an F in this class and I will
              turn you into the univerisity's academic integrity
              group.
            </p>

	    <p>
	      <h5>Quizzes</h5> I will give you full credit on your
	      lowest quiz grade for the quarter. That way, if you need
	      to miss a class and there is a quiz, you won't be
	      penalized. If you take all of the quizzes, I will
	      replace your lowest quiz score with full credit.
	    </p>
	    
	    <p>
	      <h5>Leading a lecture</h5> My goal is for all of you to
	      get full credit for leading a lecture! Here's how I will
	      break down the points for your grade when you lead a
	      lecture:
	      <ul>
		<li>
		  (1/4 to total) -- Show up to the pre-lecture
		  practice talk and have a talk that is ready to
		  present. It's ok if your talk isn't polished, and in
		  fact you can expect it to change a lot after you get
		  feedback, but it does need to be complete and ready
		  to present.
		</li>
		<li>
		  (1/4 of total) -- Pick meaningful optional
		  reading. Should have 2-3 optional reading items and
		  a few sentences about each that explains why you
		  picked them.
		</li>
		<li>
		  (1/4 of total) -- The presentation itself (should be
		  5-10 minutes long) that goes over (1) background on
		  the required reading, (2) a balanced view of the
		  issue at hand, and (3) a summary of the optional
		  reading and why you picked it.
		</li>
		<li>
		  (1/4 of total) -- In class discussion. Create good
		  questions, make sure there is a lively discussion.
		</li>
	      </ul>
	      As a challenge to the entire class: come prepared to
	      class so that you can discuss the topics in a lively
	      debate. Since your grade depends on it, please do make
	      sure that you come to class prepared to debate.
	    </p>

	    <p>
	      <h5>Final paper</h5> Your final paper is worth 20% of
	      your final grade, here is how I will break down the
	      points:
	      <ul>
		<li>(5 points) -- Explanation of technology</li>
		<li>(5 points) -- Explanation of ethical issues with that technology</li>
		<li>(5 points) -- Depth of research</li>
		<li>(5 points) -- Organization, flow, grammar, style, etc.</li>
	      </ul>
	    </p>

            <p>
            <h5>Grade breakdown</h5>
            Your grade will be composed of the following items:
            </p>
            <table class="table table-bordered">
              <thead class="thead-dark">
                <tr>
                  <th>Item</th>
                  <th>Percent</th>
                  <th>Description</th>
                </tr>
              </thead>
              <tbody>
                <tr>
                  <td><a href="discussion.html">Class participation</a></td><td>10%</td>
                  <td>
                    You are expected to participate in all of the
                    classroom discussions, and I am hoping that you
                    will express your views. Your grade for
                    participation is based on attendance to discussion
                    section, where you will get 2% per discussion
                    section for showing up, for a total of 6% of your
                    total grade. We reserve the right to use the final
                    4% for other forms of discussion, but we will
                    define this later in the quarter.
                  </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td><a href="quizzes.html">Quizzes and reports</a></td><td>20%</td>
                  <td>
                    You will turn in two brief reports (around 1 page)
                    on the reading material, due the day of
                    class during which we discuss the material (2%
                    each for 4% of your total grade) + eight in-class
                    quizzes (not announced, worth 2% of your final
                    grade each for a total of 16%).
                  </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td><a href="final_paper.html">Final paper</a></td><td>35%</td>
                  <td>
                    Your final paper will be approximately 2000 words
                    long using a format that I will specify. Your
                    final paper consists of two milestones: Milestone
                    1 (5% of your total grade) and Milestone 2 (10% of
                    your total grade) + a final report (20% of your
                    total grade).
                  </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td><a href="presentations.html">Presentations</a></td><td>35%</td>
                  <td>
                    During the quarter, you will lead the discussion
                    for 1 lecture (15% of your total grade), and you
                    will present your final project to the class (20%
                    of your total grade).  Your final presentation
                    will be at the end of the quarter and will
                    summarize your final report.
                  </td>

            <h5>Grade scale</h5>
              I grade on a straight grade scale. Although most of the
              points in this class will come towards the end of the
              quarter, the milestones will help give you a sense of
              how well you are doing on the final project.
