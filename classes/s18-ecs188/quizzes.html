            <ul>
              <li>
                Quizzes will be given at the beginning of class and
                you will have 10 minutes to answer the questions.
              </li>
              <li>
                All of the quizzes will be short (up to 5 questions),
                and easy... as long as you have done the reading.
              </li>
              <li>
                I expect to give eight quizzes over the quarter.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Reports</h2> During the quarter, I will ask you to
            turn in two reports on the reading material. Reports are
            either a 1 page opinion essays on the reading material
            for the lecturer 1 page report, and the report
            due dates are marked on
            the <a href="lectures.html">lectures</a> page.

            I am asking for your own opinion about the text. You may
            decide to take one point that you either strongly agree
            with, or strongly disagree with, and discuss it. You may
            decide to give an opiniated overview of the whole text. It
            is your choice. However, I want you to be specific: no
            generalities, no unsupported opinions. Make sure to credit
            any ideas that is not yours.
