            <h2>Presentation and discussion leading</h2>
            <p>
              During the semester you will present one paper to the
              class. Each LECTURE will have 4-5 presenters, sign up by
              editing
              this <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HhYm-gA9ig6V-eHYhFhRdhYnLByLGqwZcV-QnfSYHfI/edit?usp=sharing">Google
              Doc</a>. I periodically grab this data from Google Docs
              and sync it to the course website. You can divide up the
              presentation responsibilities however you see fit and
              you will be graded as a group. You must present the
              paper(s) in a style where you assume everyone has read
              the paper, so you focus on the most important aspect of
              the work. You will also be responsible for clearing up
              any confusing aspects of the paper and for leading a
              discussion. Here is a rough guideline for how to lead a
              discussion:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>10 minutes on core concepts.</b>
                  Explain what this paper is about and why it is
                  important. Remember, we can assume everyone has
                  already read the paper so keep it short!
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>10 minutes of related work.</b> Discuss some
                  other work that may be related to the papers you are
                  presenting and tie them together to help give a
                  historical context of the work.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>10 minutes small group discussion.</b> Come up
                  with several questions to pose to the class to spark
                  discussions. We will discuss in small groups first.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>10 minutes class discussion.</b> Based on the
                  small group discussions, the class will vote on
                  topics to discuss as an entire class.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
              The first paper available to students is the <b>Short
              Cut</b> paper on 1/17.
            </p>

            <p>
              Note: you are required to do a practice talk with Sam
              the Wednesday before your lecture. These practice
              sessions take place during the discussion section and
              are open to the entire class.
            </p>
	    <h2>Grading rubric</h2>
	    <p>
	      When lead a lecture, we will grade you on the following
	      categories:
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      <ul>
		<li>Clarity of explanation</li>
		<li>Clarity of the main concept</li>
		<li>Smoothness and polish for the presentation</li>
		<li>Question and answer leading</li>
		<li>Additional material</li>
		<li>Discussion</li>
		<li>Practice talk</li>
	      </ul>
	    </p>
	    <h2>Quiz questions from your lecture</h2>
	    <p>
	      To help presenters align their presentations with the
	      material that's on the quiz, presenters to come up with
	      four potential quiz questions ahead of time, and we may
	      use one of them for the quiz on that topic.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      When you lead a lecture, before your practice talk
	      submit 2 medium difficulty questions and 2 hard
	      questions based on the paper that you're presenting. The
	      TA and I may pick one (or more) for the quiz.
