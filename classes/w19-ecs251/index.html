            <p>
              This class focuses on hot topics in Operating
              Systems. We will discuss classic papers in the area as
              well as cutting-edge research. We will discuss classic
              papers in the area as well as cutting-edge research. We
              will explore new ideas through projects and improve
              skills in presentations, critical thinking, systems and
              security programming, and creativity. The class format
              will consist of lectures, group meetings, and class
              project presentations.
            </p>

            <p>
              The prerequisite for this class is undergraduate
              operating systems. Some of the topics we will explore
              are: kernels, security, reliability and finding bugs,
              and distributed systems.
            </p>

            <h2>Lectures</h2>
            <p>
              You are responsible for knowing about all announcements
              made in lecture. We will discuss expectations about the
              project, suggestions for how to succeed, and grading
              guidelines in class, and general class policy issues, so
              make sure you don't miss any lectures.
            </p>

	    <h2>Textbooks</h2>
	    <p>For the first half of the course where we focus on
	    operating system fundamentals, the textbook we'll
	    use <a href="http://www.ostep.org/">Operating Systems:
		Three Easy Pieces</a>.
	    </p>
