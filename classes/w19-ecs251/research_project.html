            <h2>Research Project</h2>
            <p>
              You will design and carry out a quarter-long research
              project (done in teams). I hope that these projects will
              lead to published papers. The timeline for the projects
              is as follows:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>1/22:</b> inform me of your group's
                  membership. Groups should generally consist of two
                  or three people. Your project partner will have a
                  substantial effect on your experience in this
                  course, so choose carefully.
                </li>

                <li>
                  <b>1/24:</b> inform me of your project choice. This
                  will be an email with a brief description of what
                  you plan on doing for the quarter.
                </li>

                <li>
                  <b>2/7:</b> project proposals are due (you can find
                  more
                  information <a href="#writing_an_intro">here</a>). Your
                  proposal should state the problem your project will
                  address, the motivation for why this is an
                  interesting problem, the goal of your project, the
                  relationship between your project and other work,
                  the plan and methodology for your project, and the
                  resources needed to carry out your project. Include
                  a set of incremental milestones that you will
                  achieve in carrying out the project and a schedule
                  for meeting these milestones.
                </li>

                <li>
                  <b>3/5 - 3/14:</b> Project presentations. You can find more information
                  about presentations in class.
                </li>

                <li>
                  <b>3/20:</b> Final project due.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
              Project groups should be 3-4 members. Any other group
              size needs explicit approval by the professor.
            </p>

            <p>
              This quarter I am not going to give out project
              ideas. You are responsible for coming up with a research
              idea by yourself, but I encourage you to start this
              process early and to solicit feedback from me.
            </p>

            <p>
              For any part of the project you turn in, you must usenix
              two-column formatting. For an example, feel free to
              start from the a latex template or you
              can use the latex template that I personally use for my
              papers (this one includes a makefile)
              <a href="/assets/ecs251/latex-example.tgz">latex-example.tgz</a>. Note:
              You are required to use LaTeX in this class.
            </p>

            <p>
              About Latex, for those of you who are not familiar with it, try to
              read tutorials like this:
              http://www.maths.tcd.ie/~dwilkins/LaTeXPrimer/
            </p>

            <p>
              For windows users, we suggest using MikTeX or Cygwin, or
              http://www.latexeditor.org/index.html  that makes using
              LaTeX a little easier.
            </p>

	    <a name="writing_an_intro"></a>
	    <h2 style="padding-top: 3.5em">Writing an intro</h2> There are many different ways to
	    write a good introduction. I recommend you find your
	    favorite papers and reverse engineer an outline for the
	    introduction to get an idea of how other people write
	    introductions. This is my approach to writing
	    introductions:

	    <ul>
	      <li>1-2 paragraphs about what problem you are solving and why it is important.</li>
	      <li>1-2 paragraphs about how other people have solved this problem and how they fall short.</li>
	      <li>1 paragraph (optional) what is difficult about this problem.</li>
	      <li>1-2 paragraphs about your plan on why it is better than current approaches.</li>
	      <li>1 paragraph to summarize results, or for your project proposals summarize your anticipated results.</li>
	    </ul>

	    <h2>Project proposal</h2>
	    Your project proposal should include the following sections:
	    <ul>
	      <li>Introduction.</li>
	      <li>Timeline of what you plan to accomplish and by when.</li>
	      <li>Evaluation plan.</li>
	      <li>Anticipated results.</li>
	      <li>You are required to use LaTeX for your project proposals and you must submit it in PDF format.</li>
	    </ul>

	    <p>
	      You will be graded on the clarity and quality of your
	      presentation, not on your research ideas. Grammar and
	      spelling mistakes will affect your grade. I expect you
	      to have a clear problem statement with citations that
	      back up your claims as to why this is an important
	      problem, a classification of the most closely related
	      work and an explanation of why it does not solve the
	      problem you are interested in, and a clear explanation
	      of what you plan on doing and why you think it will
	      solve the problem you are interested in. Overall you
	      should turn in an introduction that rivals the quality
	      of the introductions we read in class. The class staff
	      will provide written feedback on your research ideas to
	      give you a suggestions on how to proceed for the
	      remainder of the semester.
