            <h2>Research Project</h2>
            <p>
              You will design and carry out a quarter-long research
              project (done in teams). I hope that these projects will
              lead to published papers. The timeline for the projects
              is as follows:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>1/22:</b> inform me of your group's
                  membership. Groups should generally consist of 3
                  or 4 people. Your project partner will have a
                  substantial effect on your experience in this
                  course, so choose carefully.
                </li>

                <li>
                  <b>1/24:</b> inform me of your project choice. This
                  will be an email with a brief description of what
                  you plan on doing for the quarter.
                </li>

                <li>
                  <b>2/7:</b> project proposals are due (you can find
                  more
                  information <a href="#writing_an_intro">here</a>). Your
                  proposal should state the problem your project will
                  address, the motivation for why this is an
                  interesting problem, the goal of your project, the
                  relationship between your project and other work,
                  the plan and methodology for your project, and the
                  resources needed to carry out your project. Include
                  a set of incremental milestones that you will
                  achieve in carrying out the project and a schedule
                  for meeting these milestones.
                </li>

                <li>
                  <b>3/12 - 3/14:</b> Project presentations. You can find more information
                  about presentations in class.
                </li>

                <li>
                  <b>3/20:</b> Final project due.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
              Project groups should be 3-4 members. Any other group
              size needs explicit approval by the professor.
            </p>

            <p>
              This quarter I am not going to give out project
              ideas. You are responsible for coming up with a research
              idea by yourself, but I encourage you to start this
              process early and to solicit feedback from me.
            </p>

            <p>
              For any part of the project you turn in, you must usenix
              two-column formatting. For an example, feel free to
              start from the a latex template or you
              can use the latex template that I personally use for my
              papers (this one includes a makefile)
              <a href="/assets/ecs251/latex-example.tgz">latex-example.tgz</a>. Note:
              You are required to use LaTeX in this class.
            </p>

            <p>
              About Latex, for those of you who are not familiar with it, try to
              read tutorials like this:
              http://www.maths.tcd.ie/~dwilkins/LaTeXPrimer/
            </p>

            <p>
              For windows users, we suggest using MikTeX or Cygwin, or
              http://www.latexeditor.org/index.html  that makes using
              LaTeX a little easier.
            </p>

	    <h2>Final presentation grading</h2>
	    See slides from lecture for more details on what we're expecting. We will grade you on:
	    <ul>
	      <li>Clarity and quality of presentation</li>
	      <li>Ability to explain the problem and set the appropriate context</li>
	      <li>Ability to explain the system you built</li>
	      <li>Quality of the live demo</li>
	      <li>How well you handle Q/A</li>
	    </ul>

	    <h2>Final project grading</h2> See slides from lecture for
	    more details on what we're expecting. This quarter we're
	    going to use slides and source code as the artifacts that
	    you're going to turn in for your grade. We will grade you
	    on:
	    <ul>
	      <li>Code quality. To get points you must include a
	      README file in your repo that outlines the basic
	      structure of your code and how the concepts from your
	      project map to actual code. Also, we're expecting
	      significant contributions from all groups.</li>
	      <li>Clarity and quality of explanation</li>
	      <li>How significant was the system you built. We've been
	      giving all groups feedback on this during our weekly
	      meetings, so I'm not expecting any surprises here.</li>
	      <li>Result. Basic results will get you most of the
	      points, but we're reserving a few points in this
	      category for exceptional results.</li>
	    </ul>

	    <h2>Project meetings</h2>
	    <p>
	      In the second half of this quarter your group will have
	      weekly meetings with Sam and the TA. <i>Before</i> this
	      meeting we expect you to meet as a group and plan your
	      week. These meetings can be short (30 minutes) but you
	      must meet as a group to talk about what you did over the
	      previous week, what you plan to do during the upcoming
	      week, and any issues or problems that you've
	      encountered.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      As a part of your grade, <i>before</i> your weekly
	      meeting with the professor you must turn in a document
	      that summarizes your meeting. In particular:
	      <ul>
		<li>You will use Trello to keep an up-to-date list of
		what everyone is doing. Your Trello board will have a
		list of tasks divided into four categories: up next
		(priority order), in progress, blocked, and done.</li>
		<li>You will submit a short summary for all group
		members that includes a few sentences about (1) what
		did they do last week, (2) what are they going to do
		this week, and (3) any issues they're having / things
		they're stuck on.</li>
		<li>You will draft this document using Markdown and
		github. You will submit a link to this document
		directly in this assignment.</li>
		<li>Your document will include a link to your Trello
		board and any commits that team members submitted in
		the previous week.</li>
	      </ul>
	      Please note that we are expecting all group members to
	      commit meaningful code each week, which we will review
	      in our weekly meetings.
	    </p>

	    <a name="writing_an_intro"></a>
	    <h2 style="padding-top: 3.5em">Writing an intro</h2> There are many different ways to
	    write a good introduction. I recommend you find your
	    favorite papers and reverse engineer an outline for the
	    introduction to get an idea of how other people write
	    introductions. This is my approach to writing
	    introductions:

	    <ul>
	      <li>1-2 paragraphs about what problem you are solving and why it is important.</li>
	      <li>1-2 paragraphs about how other people have solved this problem and how they fall short.</li>
	      <li>1 paragraph (optional) what is difficult about this problem.</li>
	      <li>1-2 paragraphs about your plan on why it is better than current approaches.</li>
	      <li>1 paragraph to summarize results, or for your project proposals summarize your anticipated results.</li>
	    </ul>

	    <h2>Project proposal</h2>
	    Your project proposal should include the following sections:
	    <ul>
	      <li>Introduction.</li>
	      <li>Timeline of what you plan to accomplish and by when.</li>
	      <li>Evaluation plan.</li>
	      <li>Anticipated results.</li>
	      <li>You are required to use LaTeX for your project proposals and you must submit it in PDF format.</li>
	    </ul>

	    <p>
	      You will be graded on the clarity and quality of your
	      presentation, not on your research ideas. Grammar and
	      spelling mistakes will affect your grade. I expect you
	      to have a clear problem statement with citations that
	      back up your claims as to why this is an important
	      problem, a classification of the most closely related
	      work and an explanation of why it does not solve the
	      problem you are interested in, and a clear explanation
	      of what you plan on doing and why you think it will
	      solve the problem you are interested in. Overall you
	      should turn in an introduction that rivals the quality
	      of the introductions we read in class. The class staff
	      will provide written feedback on your research ideas to
	      give you a suggestions on how to proceed for the
	      remainder of the semester.
