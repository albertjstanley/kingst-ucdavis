            <h2>Homework</h2> 
	    <p>
	      During the first part of the quarter, we will have three
	      homework assignments. These assignments are designed to
	      reinforce the concepts around threads from a programmers
	      perspective, use the C or C++ programming langauge, and
	      make heavy use of the pthreads abstraction.
	    </p>
	    <h2>Late homework</h2>
	    <p>
	      In general, we don't accept late homework
	      assignments. However, to provide flexibility for
	      students, we will offer all students one late day that
	      they can use for either homework 2 or homework 3. To use
	      a late day simply email Sam and Art and let us know that
	      you plan to use one, and then submit your assignment
	      sometime within the 24 hour window after the due day.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      You only have one late day to use during the quarter,
	      and it's designed to provide you with flexibility in
	      case you get sick, have a family emergency, or any other
	      unexpected events. Use your late day wisely.
