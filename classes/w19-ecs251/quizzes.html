		We will have four in-class quizzes this quarter. You

		midterm or final, if we had one.
              </li>
              <li>
		Quizzes will be on 1/17, 1/24, 1/31, and 2/7.
              </li>
              <li>
		You will have 15 minutes to complete the quiz.
              </li>
              <li>
		They will vary in difficulty with some being
		relatively easy and others being hard.
